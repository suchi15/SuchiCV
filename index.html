  <h3>Books and Teachings</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Multiple projects which were blocked due to COVID are now getting unblocked
    and hopefully we will have more launch anouncements next time.</li>

    <li>On product overview, We are partnering with BuyX team to launch PO just before Feature bullet for all marketplace.</li>
    <li>We have completed coding 1 week ahead of time for phase 1 and
    completed phase 2 changes also during that time. Thanks especially to Pruthvi for leading the changes.</li>
    <li>It is in pipeline currently. BuyX team did find a bug in their code and we were held up because of that.
    So we further took advantage of the delay and we are planning to add more PTs to the experiment.
    Initially we were planning to go live with 24 PTs in US but not adding config for another 19 PTs.
    Thanks to Mohit</li>
    <li>And thanks to Hephzi for making sure testing is completed with priority</li>
